Site is published at https://findthespecies.netlify.app/

Functionality added so far - AppBar is created, no links work, responsive (Appbar links are not seen on smaller screens, links will be accessible only from the drawer)
Find the species project is used to identify species, add observations, refer to guides, and learn to identify species
Users should be able to login and share observations or ask for identification by sharing pictures.
The website will only be a skeleton and will not contain the entire database. Some parts will use an api https://www.gbif.org/developer/species and some will refer to the database. The database will be a sample, most species wont have images available.

Next steps -

1. create drawer and links in AppBar which lead to corresponding pages using react routing.
2. Create Bird Identifier page, at first simply retrieve info of a bird from an API.
